// This file is a placeholder for GSAP animations.
// You would import GSAP and define your animation functions here.
// For example:

/*
import { gsap } from "gsap";

export const animateLevelUp = (element: HTMLElement) => {
  gsap.fromTo(element, 
    { scale: 0.5, opacity: 0 }, 
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: 0.5, ease: "back.out(1.7)" }
  );
  // Add more complex timeline animations for level up effect
};

export const animateTaskComplete = (element: HTMLElement) => {
  const tl = gsap.timeline();
  tl.to(element, { x: 10, opacity: 0.8, duration: 0.1, ease: "power1.inOut" })
    .to(element, { x: -100, opacity: 0, duration: 0.3, ease: "power1.in" });
  // Example: slide out and fade
};

// These functions would be called from your React components at appropriate times,
// e.g., when XP leads to a level up, or when a task is marked as complete.
*/

// Note: To use GSAP, you'll need to install it:
// npm install gsap
// or
// yarn add gsap

console.log("GSAP animations would be initialized and managed here.");
